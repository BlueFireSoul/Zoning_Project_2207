# Zoning_Project_2207

This paper examines the effects of exclusionary zoning policies, specifically density and height regulations, on the supply of heterogeneous housing units and their subsequent implications for different income groups. Using a comprehensive dataset on U.S. housing, I document a robust and pervasive pattern â€“ smaller housing units tend to exhibit higher density and greater building height. This pattern suggests that exclusionary zoning policies may systematically reduce the supply of smaller housing units, disproportionately affecting lower-income households who tend to occupy these units. I develop a theoretical housing production model with endogenous housing density and height to illustrate the impact of density and height regulations on housing production across different sizes. To quantify the differential welfare implications across income levels, I embed this housing model into a spatial urban framework with heterogeneous income groups, focusing on the Greater Boston region.
